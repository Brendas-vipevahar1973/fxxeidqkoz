Just walked out of 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Raid 2, and my brain is like spaghetti with a side of fireworks. Seriously, what just happened in there? A tornado of punches, blood, and some kind of philosophical tornado—yes, two tornadoes, deal with it. My head hurts, probably from all those damn fists flying. But my god, can someone actually survive that many punches? This   makes it seem like everyone in Jakarta is an indestructible action figure.

There were parts that felt like I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the director's fever dream, like, what did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? There’s that scene in the kitchen that just devolves into an orchestra of knuckles and elbows. Honestly, it was strangely beautiful... if your version of beautiful includes shattered glass and a symphony of grunts. And the mud fight—who knew mud-flinging could be choreographed like a violent ballet? Thank you, Raid 2, for that unwanted craving for destruction, now I just wanna karate chop my way through the day.

> And can we talk about the dude with the baseball bat? Was he joking? Was I supposed to be scared or just side-eyeing the whole scenario with a skeptical eyebrow? Sir, this is not a sport. Well, if it was, it's like the most extreme version of baseball - the one that no sane person would 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, but hey, quite the match.

At one point, my brain was so fried I half expected them to break into song, Bollywood style. But nope, just more fists. And cars. And some 𝘴𝘶𝘣𝘵𝘪𝘵𝘭𝘦s flashing so fast I might need to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 later just to rewind in slo-mo. And that soundtrack? My heart syncopated right alongside it, like the dubstep party nobody invited me to. Thanks, Raid 2, for making me feel like I went clubbing and got kicked out for not dancing aggressively enough.

Here's the part where I try to make sense of it:
// This is where the code blows up
function fightSceneFastForward() {
  if (punches === Infinity) {
    return continue 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 until you believe it;
  }
}

There it is, pure cinema on adrenaline, deliciously chaotic yet infuriating when my sane brain kicks back in. But I guess that's why we keep 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, right? To see how many punches it takes before the hero doesn't get back up. Spoiler: apparently that's not gonna happen soon. So yeah, all in all, Raid 2 was like mainlining chaos with a twist of genius. Would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again? Sure, once my brain stops spinning in its own orbit.
